# Python OOP Programming Demo: A Plane War Game üõ©Ô∏è

Welcome to my Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) demonstration project, where I've developed an engaging and interactive Plane War Game. This project showcases my proficiency in Python programming, OOP principles, and game development. Use arrow keys to navigate your plane and the spacebar to fire! Shoot enemies, pick supply drops, and fresh your highest record score!

## üåü Highlights
- **Innovative Game Design:** Developed a captivating and user-friendly Plane War Game, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Leveraged OOP principles to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code, enhancing the project's scalability and adaptability.
- **Multimedia Integration:** Integrated various multimedia elements such as fonts, music, and paint to enrich the gaming experience.

## üöÄ Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Experience dynamic and challenging gameplay with varying enemy types and bullet mechanics.
- **Supply Drops and Record Score** Collect supply drops to gain advantages and enhance your gaming experience. Highest game score will be keeped.
- **Interactive User Interface:** Enjoy an interactive and user-friendly interface with intuitive controls and feedback.
- **Customizable Elements:** Customize various game elements, including fonts and music, to create a personalized gaming experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python:** Utilized Python for developing the core game logic and implementing OOP principles.
- **Pygame:** Leveraged the Pygame library to facilitate game development, including rendering graphics and handling user input.
